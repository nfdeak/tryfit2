# Architectural Decisions

## 1. SQLite over PostgreSQL
**Decision**: Use SQLite (`file:./dev.db`) instead of PostgreSQL.
**Reason**: No Docker available on the dev machine. SQLite is zero-config, runs in-process, and Prisma supports it natively. JSON arrays are stored as serialized strings and parsed in route handlers.
**Trade-off**: No native JSON column type; manual `JSON.parse()` / `JSON.stringify()` required for array fields.

## 2. User ID as CUID String
**Decision**: Changed User `id` from auto-increment Int to `@default(cuid())` String.
**Reason**: Google OAuth users need a stable ID before database insertion. CUIDs are URL-safe, globally unique, and don't leak sequence information. All foreign keys (`userId`) across models reference this string ID.

## 3. Manual Google OAuth (no Passport.js)
**Decision**: Implement Google OAuth 2.0 flow manually using `fetch()` calls to Google's token and userinfo endpoints.
**Reason**: Avoids adding Passport middleware complexity for a single OAuth provider. The flow is straightforward: redirect → callback → exchange code → fetch profile → find-or-create user → issue JWT cookie → redirect to frontend.

## 4. JWT in httpOnly Cookies
**Decision**: Store JWT tokens in httpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookies instead of localStorage.
**Reason**: httpOnly cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, preventing XSS token theft. SameSite=Lax allows the Google OAuth redirect flow while blocking CSRF from third-party sites.

## 5. Zustand for State Management
**Decision**: Use Zustand over Redux or React Context.
**Reason**: Minimal boilerplate, no providers needed, excellent TypeScript support, and built-in shallow equality checks. The app's state is moderate in complexity — Zustand handles it cleanly without Redux's ceremony.

## 6. AI Meal Plan Generation via Claude API
**Decision**: Use Anthropic's Claude API for generating personalised 7-day meal plans.
**Reason**: Claude excels at structured JSON generation from natural language prompts. The prompt includes all user profile data (macros, preferences, allergies, cuisine, equipment) to produce contextually relevant meal plans.
**Rate limit**: 3 generations per user per day (in-memory map).

## 7. TDEE Calculation: Mifflin-St Jeor
**Decision**: Use Mifflin-St Jeor equation for BMR calculation.
**Reason**: Most accurate BMR formula for the general population (within ±10%). Combined with activity level multipliers and diet intensity deficits (300/500/750 kcal) to derive daily calorie targets.

## 8. Variable Meals Per Day (3/4/5)
**Decision**: Support 3, 4, or 5 meals per day as a user preference.
**Reason**: Different dietary approaches (IF, standard, frequent feeding) require different meal counts. The tracker, calendar dots, and plan view all dynamically adapt to the user's chosen meal count.

## 9. Shopping List People Multiplier
**Decision**: Client-side quantity multiplication (1-5x) with server-persisted people count.
**Reason**: Keeps the shopping list generation simple (always for 1 person) while allowing families to scale quantities. The multiplier is applied in the UI using `multiplyQuantity()` — no re-generation needed.

## 10. Onboarding as Gated Flow
**Decision**: Users must complete a 7-step onboarding wizard before accessing the main app.
**Reason**: AI meal plan generation requires body stats, preferences, and goals. The onboarding collects all necessary data in a guided, mobile-friendly flow. Users can skip AI generation and use hardcoded plans as fallback.

## 11. Optimistic UI for Meal Tracking
**Decision**: Toggle meal eaten status optimistically in Zustand, then sync to server. Rollback on failure.
**Reason**: Immediate visual feedback is critical for a tracking app. The toggle operation is low-risk (idempotent PUT), and the server is the source of truth on page reload.

## 13. Custom Meal Plan Instructions via Free-Text Input
**Decision**: Add a free-text textarea (max 500 chars) in the Profile tab to let users provide natural language customisation instructions for AI meal plan generation.
**Reason**: Users need fine-grained control beyond profile preferences (e.g. "more eggs at breakfast", "avoid rajma this week"). Instructions are appended to the Claude prompt with highest priority (after allergy/safety restrictions). Auto-saved with 500ms debounce to avoid a manual save button.
**Trade-off**: Using `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (not Haiku) since the deprecated Haiku model is unavailable as of April 2026. Custom instructions are persisted in DB (not ephemeral) so they carry over across regenerations — user must explicitly clear them.

## 12. PWA with Workbox Runtime Caching
**Decision**: Cache Google Fonts with CacheFirst, API responses with NetworkFirst.
**Reason**: Fonts rarely change (365-day cache). API data should always try network first for freshness, falling back to cache for offline resilience.

## 15. Vercel + Neon Production Deployment
**Decision**: Deploy as a single Vercel project with the React SPA and an Express API serverless function. Use Neon serverless PostgreSQL via `@prisma/adapter-neon` + `@neondatabase/serverless` (with `ws` for the WebSocket pool) for both local dev and production. This supersedes decision #1 (SQLite for local dev).
**Reason**: Vercel + Neon is the lowest-friction free-tier path for a JWT-cookie SPA + Express API. The Neon driver adapter avoids cold-start TCP connection cost on serverless by using HTTP/WebSocket pooling. Splitting `src/index.ts` into `src/app.ts` (no `.listen()`) + `src/server.ts` (local dev `.listen()`) + `api/index.ts` (Vercel handler) gives the same Express app a production serverless entry without forking code. Moving local dev to Neon (free tier branch) eliminates provider drift between environments — migrations behave identically everywhere.
**Trade-off**: Local dev now requires a Neon connection string instead of a zero-config SQLite file, so the first-time setup has one extra step. The existing local SQLite users database is not migrated — seed script must be re-run against Neon. `schema.postgres.prisma` is kept as a backup copy of the active schema.

## 16. Lazy-Loaded Neon Adapter
**Decision**: The Prisma singleton in `server/src/lib/prisma.ts` only requires `@prisma/adapter-neon` / `@neondatabase/serverless` / `ws` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'` and `DATABASE_URL` is set. Otherwise it falls back to a standard `new PrismaClient()`.
**Reason**: Keeps local development working when Neon-related env vars aren't configured, and lets the test/migration scripts use the standard client without pulling in serverless dependencies.

## 14. Username/Password Signup (No Email Verification)
**Decision**: Add a simple signup flow with just username + password — no email, no OTP, no verification. Usernames stored lowercase and matched case-insensitively. Passwords hashed with bcrypt (saltRounds: 12). Rate limit: 5 signups per IP per hour, 30 username checks per minute.
**Reason**: Keep friction low for new users while providing basic abuse protection. Username uniqueness is enforced case-insensitively by normalising to lowercase before storage and lookup. Login endpoint falls back to exact-match lookup for any legacy mixed-case accounts.
**Trade-off**: No password recovery (no email on file), no account deduplication across Google+credentials (a user may have both). Reserved usernames (admin, root, system, support, help, dietplan, api, null, undefined) are blocked server-side and client-side.

## Production Deployment Audit (2026-04-12)

Full audit and fix pass for Vercel production deployment. Below are all root causes found and files changed.

### Root Causes Found

1. **Cookie SameSite misconfiguration (CRITICAL)** — `setAuthCookie.ts` used `sameSite: 'none'` in production. Since the API and frontend share the same origin on Vercel (via rewrites), `SameSite=None` is wrong — it requires `Secure` and can cause cookies to be rejected by some browsers. Changed to `sameSite: 'lax'` (same-origin default) which works correctly for both same-origin requests and top-level navigations like Google OAuth redirects.

2. **Missing try/catch on route handlers** — Login, signup, check-username, plan GET, and week-start routes were missing try/catch, meaning any Prisma error would crash the serverless function silently instead of returning a 500 JSON response. Wrapped all async route handlers in try/catch.

3. **Prisma binary target missing for Vercel** — `schema.prisma` lacked `binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]`. Without `rhel-openssl-3.0.x`, Prisma Client fails to load on Vercel's Amazon Linux runtime.

4. **Prisma singleton not cached in production** — `prisma.ts` only cached the singleton in `globalThis` when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, meaning each warm Lambda invocation could create a new PrismaClient. Fixed to always cache in `globalThis`.

5. **Inconsistent API URL resolution in frontend** — `weightStore.ts` used bare `/api/...` paths (bypassing `apiUrl()`), and `Onboarding.tsx`, `ProfileTab.tsx`, `AuthScreen.tsx`, `Login.tsx`, `MealPlanCustomiser.tsx` all used bare fetch/XHR paths. Fixed all to use `apiUrl()` for consistency.

6. **Axios defaults not configured globally** — `axios.defaults.baseURL` and `axios.defaults.withCredentials` were not set, requiring every call to manually pass `withCredentials: true`. Added global config in `api.ts` imported from `main.tsx`.

7. **Missing env-var startup check** — No logging of which environment variables were missing at boot, making debugging on Vercel painful. Added startup check that logs missing required/optional vars.

8. **Error middleware leaked stack traces** — Production error handler logged `err.message` only (not the full stack). Also lacked `headersSent` guard. Fixed both.

9. **Missing unhandled rejection handler** — Unhandled promise rejections in serverless would crash silently. Added `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)`.

10. **Deprecated PWA meta tag** — `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable">` without `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable">` causes a console deprecation warning. Added the modern tag.

11. **Serverless function timeout too short** — `maxDuration: 30` in `vercel.json` is too short for AI meal plan generation (which streams for 30-60s). Increased to 60.

12. **Pre-deploy script wrong path** — Referenced `server/api/index.ts` instead of `api/index.ts`.

13. **Dead code in Onboarding skip flow** — Empty `POST /api/auth/login` call with no credentials was a no-op. Removed.

### Files Changed

### Vercel Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Neon pooled connection string |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Yes | Neon direct (non-pooled) for migrations |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Long random string (`openssl rand -base64 48`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | Must be `production` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | For AI | Required for meal plan generation |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Recommended | e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app` — used for CORS and Google OAuth redirects |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Recommended | Same as FRONTEND_URL (legacy compat) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | For OAuth | Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | For OAuth | Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` | For OAuth | Must match Google Console exactly, e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback` |

### Deploy Commands

```bash
# Push fixes to GitHub (triggers Vercel auto-deploy)
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: production deployment audit — cookie, error handling, API paths"
git push origin main

# Or manual deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Database Sync

No schema changes were made to the data models. The only schema change was adding `binaryTargets` to the generator block, which only affects client generation (not the database). No migrations needed.

---

## 17. Meal Replacer Feature (2026-04-17)

### Overview
The Meal Replacer lets users swap any planned meal with what they actually ate,
tracking real macros against the plan. Three food data sources cascade:
Open Food Facts (free, 3M+ products) → USDA FoodData Central → Claude AI fallback.

### New Database Models

| Model | Purpose | Key constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `MealReplacement` | One replacement per meal slot per day | `@@unique([userId, date, mealIndex])` — upsert semantics |
| `FoodSearchCache` | 7-day TTL cache for combined search results | `@@unique([query, source])` |
| `RecentFoodLog` | Last 10 foods the user searched/logged | Indexed by `[userId, usedAt]` |

### Migration
```bash
# Already applied to Neon production on 2026-04-17
cd server
npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=src/prisma/schema.prisma
```

### New Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `USDA_API_KEY` | Vercel env vars (all environments) | `jR8QDTnz7KeQWGEgwQysUNzIBSBC6cY0OZ4KPMUk` |
| `AI_FOOD_ESTIMATE_DAILY_LIMIT` | Vercel env vars | `20` (default if unset) |

> **Action required**: Add these two env vars in the Vercel dashboard under
> Project Settings → Environment Variables for Production, Preview, Development.

### Food Data Sources

1. **Open Food Facts** (`openFoodFactsService.ts`) — Free, no API key, 8s timeout, up to 6 results, handles kJ→kcal conversion
2. **USDA FoodData Central** (`usdaService.ts`) — Free with API key, 8s timeout, nutrient IDs mapped, graceful fallback if key not set
3. **Claude AI** (`aiFoodService.ts`) — Fallback when OFF+USDA return <3 results; 20 requests/user/day rate limit; model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`

### Search Strategy (`food.ts /api/food/search`)
1. Check `FoodSearchCache` for unexpired combined results
2. `Promise.allSettled([OFF, USDA])` — parallel, either can fail gracefully
3. Deduplicate by normalized food name
4. If <3 results → call Claude AI for additional estimates
5. Cache combined results for 7 days
6. Passive cleanup deletes expired cache entries on each request

### Interaction Model

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| Swipe left on meal card | Reveals terracotta "Replace Meal" action panel |
| Long press (mobile) | Context menu: Replace / Mark eaten |
| Right-click (desktop) | Same context menu |

### Component Architecture
```
MealsTab
├── SwipeableMealCard (per meal)
│   ├── ReplacedMealCard (if replaced — amber styling, undo button)
│   └── Normal meal card (if not)
└── MealReplacerSheet (bottom sheet modal with drag-to-dismiss)
    ├── MealReplacerSearch (screen 1: quick picks, recents, search)
    ├── MealReplacerResults (screen 2: live results with loading)
    ├── MealReplacerQuantity (screen 3: serving, quantity, live macros)
    └── MealReplacerAI (screen 4: natural language AI estimator)
```

### TrackerTab Integration
- `MealRow` shows ✏️ icon and actual food name for replaced meals
- Amber styling distinguishes replaced meals from normal ones
- Day totals in MealsTab use replacement macros when present

### State Management
- `mealReplacerStore.ts` — Zustand store with replacements keyed by `"YYYY-MM-DD-mealIndex"`
- Optimistic undo (instant UI update, revert on API failure)
- `fetchReplacementsForWeek()` loads all replacements on mount

### API Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/food/search?q=&limit=` | GET | Combined multi-source search with caching |
| `/api/food/ai-estimate` | POST | Natural language AI macro estimation (rate-limited) |
| `/api/food/recent` | GET | Last 10 recent food logs for quick picks |
| `/api/meals/replace` | POST | Upsert replacement, auto-marks eaten, logs to recent |
| `/api/meals/replacements?date=` | GET | Replacements for a specific date |
| `/api/meals/replacements/week` | GET | All replacements for current week |
| `/api/meals/replace/:id` | DELETE | Delete replacement with ownership check |

### Accuracy Limitations
- Open Food Facts data is community-contributed; some entries may be inaccurate
- USDA provides lab-tested data but mostly US-centric foods
- AI estimates are approximations; marked with ✨ and muted styling in the UI
- All AI-estimated foods set `isAiEstimate: true` in the database

# 6-Feature Drop (2026-04-17)

## Bug Fix: Post-Deploy Click Blocking

**Root cause**: `SwipeableMealCard` spread both `swipe.handlers` and `longPress.handlers` onto the same div. `longPress.onTouchStart` overrides `swipe.onTouchStart`, creating a race condition that caused taps to be swallowed and never dispatched to child buttons.

**Fix**: Rewrote `MealsTab.tsx` entirely, removing `SwipeableMealCard`. All meal interactions now use standard `<button onClick>` handlers with no touch/pointer event customisation.

---

## Feature 1 — Week Calendar Strip (MealsTab)

- `mealsCalendarOffset` in `appStore` (0 = current week, -1 = previous, max -8).
- Dates computed with `date-fns` (`startOfWeek(weekStartsOn:1)`, `addWeeks`, `addDays`).
- Forward navigation disabled when `offset >= 0`.
- `selectedDate` in `appStore` is shared between Meals and Tracker tabs.

---

## Feature 2 — Water Intake Logging

**Schema**: `WaterLog` with `@@unique([userId, date])` — one row per user per calendar day.

**Key decisions**:
- Use ISO date string (not timestamp) as key to avoid timezone edge cases.
- `POST /api/water` upserts using Prisma `@@unique` composite key.
- Tap glass N → set count to N; tap same glass again → decrement to N-1.
- Optimistic UI with revert on API failure.
- State stored in `appStore.waterByDate[date]` (−1 sentinel = not yet loaded).

---

## Feature 3 — Tracker Tab Enhancements

**Weekly + Monthly Adherence**: Two `AdherenceCard` components fed by `GET /api/tracker/summary?period=week` and `?period=month`. Fetched in `Promise.allSettled` to avoid serial waterfalls.

**Goal Countdown** (`GET /api/tracker/goal-countdown`):
- Latest `WeightLog` → current weight.
- `weeklyLossRate`: low=0.3kg, moderate=0.5kg, high=0.75kg/week.
- `weeksNeeded = (currentWeight - targetWeight) / weeklyLossRate`.
- `goalDate = today + weeksNeeded weeks`.
- Urgency threshold: `daysLeft <= 14`.

**Month Calendar**: `trackerCalendarMonth` in `appStore` (YYYY-MM), defaults to current month. Forward navigation capped at current month.

---

## Feature 4 — Collapsible Tip Categories

CSS `max-height` transition (0 → 2000px, 250ms ease-in-out) — no JS height measurement or library needed for static content. State persisted in `localStorage` under key `tipsExpandedSections`. Default: all collapsed except `prep-guide`.

---

## Feature 5 — Weekly Meal Prep Guide

**Decision**: Embed prep guide generation inside the existing AI call (same JSON blob) — no extra API round-trip.

**Storage**: `MealPlan.mealPrepGuide Json?` (JSONB). Null for pre-feature plans → fallback UI prompts user to regenerate.

**API**: `GET /api/plan/meal-prep-guide` returns the active plan's `mealPrepGuide`.

---

## Feature 6 — Plan Duration Choice (7 or 14 days)

**Schema**: `planDuration Int @default(7)` on both `UserProfile` (preference) and `MealPlan` (snapshot at generation time). Snapshot ensures historical plans render correctly if user later switches.

**AI**: Separate `SYSTEM_PROMPT_7` / `SYSTEM_PROMPT_14`. 14-day prompt instructs Claude to maximise variety across two weeks. `maxTokens` = 14000 for 14-day plans vs 8000 for 7-day.

**Validation**: `planData.days.length !== expectedDays` throws — prevents partial plans from being stored.

**Plan day index**: `weekData` ordered by `dayIndex` (0-indexed). For 14-day plans, days 0–13 map to dates starting from `weekStartDate`.

**PATCH `/api/profile/plan-duration`**: Lightweight single-field update in `ProfileTab` so user can change preference without re-POSTing full profile.

---

## Database Migration (20260417200000_water_prep_plan_duration)

Applied with `npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=src/prisma/schema.prisma`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE "MealPlan" ADD COLUMN "planDuration" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 7;
ALTER TABLE "MealPlan" ADD COLUMN "mealPrepGuide" JSONB;
ALTER TABLE "UserProfile" ADD COLUMN "planDuration" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 7;
CREATE TABLE "water_logs" (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  "userId" TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  glasses INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "goalGlasses" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "loggedAt" TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMPTZ,
  UNIQUE("userId", date)
);
```

**Breaking changes**: None. All new columns have DEFAULT values; existing rows are unaffected.

---

## Shared Date State

`selectedDate` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) in `appStore` is the single source of truth for both Meals and Tracker tabs. `navigateToMealsFromTracker(dayIndex, date)` sets it and switches tabs simultaneously so tapping a Tracker day → "View Meal Plan" opens Meals on that exact date.

---

# Bug Fixes & Feature Enhancements — 2026-04-17 (second drop)

## Files Changed

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `client/src/components/WaterIntakeCard.tsx` | Rewritten as compact single-row dot grid |
| `client/src/components/MacroAchievementCard.tsx` | New — daily macro consumed vs. target card |
| `client/src/components/MealsTab.tsx` | Added MacroAchievementCard below water row |
| `client/src/components/TrackerTab.tsx` | Fixed calendar nav timezone bug |
| `client/src/components/Onboarding.tsx` | Country-linked city dropdown, numeric input fix, grouped cuisine, IF windows, mandatory steps 5+6 |
| `client/src/data/onboarding.ts` | Added CUISINE_OPTIONS (grouped), COUNTRY_CODES map |
| `client/src/types/index.ts` | Added IF window fields + avoidNone to OnboardingData |
| `server/src/prisma/schema.prisma` | Added countryCode, eatingWindowHours, fastingWindowHours, eatingStartTime, eatingEndTime to UserProfile |
| `server/src/prisma/migrations/20260417210000_if_windows_country_code/migration.sql` | SQL for new UserProfile columns |
| `server/src/routes/profile.ts` | Save new IF/countryCode fields from POST body |
| `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | Filter __none__ from avoidIngredients; include IF window details in prompt |

## Migration Command

```bash
cd server && npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=src/prisma/schema.prisma
```

Applied migration: `20260417210000_if_windows_country_code`

## __none__ Sentinel for avoidIngredients

- **Frontend**: when user taps "I have no ingredients to avoid", `avoidIngredients` is set to `['__none__']` and `avoidNone: true` in local state.
- **Backend profile save**: the array is saved as-is to `UserProfile.avoidIngredients`.
- **AI prompt builder** (`routes/ai.ts`): `avoidRaw.filter(a => a !== '__none__')` strips the sentinel before building the Claude prompt, so Claude never sees it.
- **Step 6 gating**: `canNext()` for step 6 checks `avoidIngredients.length > 0 || avoidNone === true` — both `['__none__']` and real selections satisfy this.

## Eating Window Hours and End Time Calculation

- `eatingWindowHours`: user-editable (4–20 hours), stored as `Int?` in `UserProfile`.
- `fastingWindowHours`: computed as `24 - eatingWindowHours`, stored as `Int?`.
- `eatingStartTime`: user-set time picker (HH:MM string), stored as `String?`.
- `eatingEndTime`: computed as `eatingStartTime + eatingWindowHours`, stored as `String?`.
- Calculation: `(startHour + eatingWindowHours) % 24`, zero-padded to HH:MM.
- AI prompt includes: `"Eating Xh (HH:MM–HH:MM), fasting Yh. Schedule all meals within the eating window."`
- Old `16_8`/`18_6` values are handled with backward-compat defaults in the prompt builder.

## Calendar Navigation Race Condition Fix (TrackerTab)

**Root cause**: `getMonthStr` used `date.toISOString().slice(0, 7)` which returns UTC time. `parseISO('YYYY-MM-01')` parses as LOCAL midnight (date-fns v2 behaviour for date-only strings). In UTC+ timezones (e.g. IST = UTC+5:30), `parseISO('2026-04-01')` = March 31 18:30 UTC, so `toISOString()` returned `'2026-03'` — making every ← click subtract TWO months instead of one.

**Fix**: Replace `getMonthStr` with `format(date, 'yyyy-MM')` from date-fns (local time). Also fixed `todayStr()` in TrackerTab and `currentMonthStr` to use `format()` for consistency. This ensures `parseISO` and `getMonthStr` both use local time, making the arithmetic correct in all timezones.

## City Data Limitations

The `country-state-city` npm package uses GeoNames database which covers major cities globally. **Limitations**:
- Smaller towns (<50k population) are often missing.
- Some countries have incomplete state coverage.
- Village-level settlements are not included.
- **Fallback**: "City not listed? Type it manually" link switches to a free-text input so no user is blocked.
- Countries not in `COUNTRY_CODES` map default to empty ISO code → free-text city input shown directly.
